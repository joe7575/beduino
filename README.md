# Beduino [beduino]

**A microcontroller for Minetest**

Beduino is a 16-bit microcontroller and development environment with
compiler, assembler, and debugger based on the mod vm16.

The mod has no dependencies, but only makes sense if it is used together with
any kind of technology mod.

Currently the mod can be used together with techpack and techage.
