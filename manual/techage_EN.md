# Beduino for Techage

Beduino is a 16-bit microcontroller system inspired by Arduino boards and kits.
Beduino can be programmed in the C-like programming language Cipol.
In order to be able to use Beduino, basic knowledge of
programming languages is an advantage.

Beduino is fully integrated into the Mod Techage and
can be used as an alternative to the Lua controller.

Further information about Beduino, the programming language and
the techage commands can be found here: https://github.com/joe7575/vm16/wiki
